Introduction
Fatigue is one of the leading causes of road accidents. This project leverages state-of-the-art Vision Transformer models to detect drowsiness in drivers. By using multiple models such as DeiT, LeViT, Swin Transformer, BEiT, and others, we explore their performance on the driver fatigue detection task.

Models Used
This repository includes the implementation and evaluation of the following models:

DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer)

A lightweight Vision Transformer optimized for high accuracy with smaller datasets.
LeViT

A fast and efficient Vision Transformer designed for low-latency applications, making it ideal for real-time fatigue detection.
Vision Transformer (ViT)

The standard Vision Transformer architecture, offering high accuracy for a variety of vision tasks.
Swin Transformer

A hierarchical Vision Transformer that processes images at multiple scales, improving performance on dense prediction tasks such as object detection and segmentation.
Due to its efficiency and high accuracy, it’s well-suited for real-time driver fatigue detection in complex environments.
BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers)

A self-supervised Vision Transformer model that learns visual representations by treating image patches as tokens, similar to language models.
BEiT’s pretraining approach allows it to achieve high performance on downstream tasks with minimal labeled data.
